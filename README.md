BananaJack
===

Goals
---

Use WebComponent to implement a BananaJack client.

If you want, you can start on these git branches:

* `start-native`: containing a skeleton for native WebComponent
* `start-stencil`: containing a skeleton for Stencil


Rules
---

The purpose is to earn lots of üçå.
The rules are a very simplified version of BlackJack.

When you enter the room

- you had to wait the end of the active round
- at the beginning of the round, two cards are given to every active players, including the *bank*
- the score is the sum of the value of your cards (King, Queen and Jack give 10, Ace can give 1 or 11).
  - if score is 21, you have a BananaJack üéâ
  - if score is greater than 21, you loose üò¢
  - otherwise you can `draw` a new card or `stay`, notice than if already have `stay` once, you cannot `draw` a card
- at the end of the round, players with greater score earn a üçå, if you have a BananaJack you earn one more üçå.
